# ðŸ’¦ Droplets ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦
Simulating the way tiny rain drops look on a screen

### To Do
- [ ] Use SVG for pixels (sharper contrast on retina)
- [ ] Add shadow to the droplets, rotate w/ orientation
- [ ] Add highlight to the droplets, rotate w/ orientation
- [ ] Set opacity of droplets based on angle... possibly rotating a linear gradient on the mask
- [ ] More advanced effects including warping of pixels, blending of pixels
- [ ] Achieve the super-bright effect
